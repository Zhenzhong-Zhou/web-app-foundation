# ADR-003 — Multi-tenancy: shared schema with `organization_id`

**Context.** It is not yet known whether this will serve one organization or many
customers. The cost of the two mistakes is wildly asymmetric: designing for multi-tenancy
and never needing it costs one column and one seed row. Retrofitting tenancy onto a live
single-tenant database touches every table, every query, and every role assignment.

**Decision.** Design multi-tenant from day one, using a **shared schema** in a single
database. Every tenant-scoped table gets `organization_id NOT NULL`, a foreign key, and an
index — created with the table, never added later. One "Default Organization" row is
seeded. Schema-per-tenant and database-per-tenant were both rejected: they are only
justified by hard compliance/isolation requirements and are far harder to reverse.

**Consequence.** The tenant filter must live in **one place** — a request-scoped context
plus a base query layer that always applies it. If `where organization_id = ?` gets
scattered across services by hand, data will eventually leak between tenants. This is the
single highest-risk area of the codebase and needs a test.

Postgres Row-Level Security may be added later as defence in depth. It is cheap to add
*because the column already exists* — the column is the irreversible decision, RLS is not.

Deferred as additive, not blocking: organization signup/onboarding, org switcher UI,
per-org settings overrides, per-org billing.
