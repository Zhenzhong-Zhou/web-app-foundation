# ADR-015 — Multiple concurrent sessions per user (amends ADR-011)

**Context.** ADR-011 states two rules that cannot both hold. Its binding-rules table
requires issuing a new session row on login and **deleting any prior one**, citing session
fixation. Its own context section requires a "your active sessions" screen with
per-device revocation — which is only meaningful if a user can hold more than one session
at a time.

Implementing login forced the contradiction into the open.

The fixation citation is also misattributed. Session fixation is an attack in which the
attacker plants a known token value that survives authentication. It is prevented by
**never adopting a client-supplied token**: `SessionService.create()` generates 32 fresh
CSPRNG bytes on every login and has no code path that accepts an incoming value. Deleting
other sessions does not contribute to that defence. It is a separate and stricter policy —
single-session — that was recorded as though it were the fixation fix.

**Decision.** Multiple concurrent sessions per user are normal and supported.

Login revokes exactly one row: the session presented in the request, if any. That row's
cookie is about to be overwritten by the response, so without the delete it would remain
live in the table with nothing able to reach it — reachable only by whoever captured the
token. Sessions belonging to other devices are untouched.

ADR-011's rule "issue a new session row on login, delete any prior one" is **superseded**
by this entry.

**Consequence.** Signing in on a phone does not sign out a laptop, which is what users
expect and what the active-sessions screen requires. `sessions.user_id` is deliberately
non-unique.

Every "sign out everywhere" operation must now be explicit, because it is no longer a side
effect of logging in. `revokeAllForUser(userId, exceptSessionId)` is that operation, and
password change, password reset, and admin-disables-user must all call it — ADR-011's rule
that password change deletes all *other* sessions is unaffected by this amendment and
becomes more important under it.

The remaining cost is unbounded session growth: a user who logs in from many devices and
never signs out accumulates rows until they expire. Lazy sweeping on login (ADR-005)
bounds it in practice. If it ever needs a hard cap, the fix is to evict the oldest session
past a limit — additive, and it needs no schema change.

Single-session remains available as a per-deployment policy if a future application
requires it. It would be a change to login, not to the schema.
