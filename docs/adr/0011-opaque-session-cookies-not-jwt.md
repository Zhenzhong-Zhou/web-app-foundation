# ADR-011 — Opaque session cookies, not JWT

> **Amended by [ADR-015](0015-multiple-concurrent-sessions-per-user.md).**
> One binding rule — delete any prior session on login — is superseded. Everything else stands.

**Context.** The choice was between a stateless JWT and a server-side session referenced
by a cookie.

JWT's single advantage is avoiding a database read per request. ADR-004 removes that
advantage entirely: permissions are scoped per organization, so every request must resolve
`(user, current_org) -> role -> permissions` against the database regardless. The read
happens either way.

What remains of JWT is its cost. Tokens cannot be revoked before expiry, so an admin
demoting or disabling a user has no immediate effect. The standard remedy is a
server-side blocklist — which is a session table with extra steps and worse ergonomics.

Two further requirements point the same way. Org switching (ADR-003) needs mutable
per-session state, which a signed token cannot hold. And a "your active sessions" screen
requires one enumerable, individually revocable record per login.

**Decision.** Opaque session tokens, stored server-side, delivered in an httpOnly cookie.

Generate 32 cryptographically random bytes per login. Send the base64url value to the
client; store only its SHA-256 hash. Hashing, not encryption — the value is only ever
verified, never read back. A database leak then yields no usable credentials, for the same
reason password hashes do not.

```sql
sessions (
  id              uuid primary key default uuidv7(),
  token_hash      text not null unique,
  user_id         uuid not null references users(id) on delete cascade,
  current_org_id  uuid references organizations(id) on delete cascade,
  issued_at       timestamptz not null default now(),
  expires_at      timestamptz not null,   -- absolute cap
  last_seen_at    timestamptz not null default now(),
  ip              inet,
  user_agent      text
)
```

Cookie flags: `httpOnly: true`, `secure: true` (relaxed only on localhost http),
`sameSite: 'lax'`, `path: '/'`.

**Consequence — binding rules.** Each of these is a security control, not a preference:

| Rule                                                                                                                                                                          | Failure it prevents                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| ~~Issue a new session row on login, delete any prior one~~ — **superseded by ADR-015**. Login revokes only the session presented in the request; other devices are untouched. | Session fixation — misattributed, see ADR-015             |
| Logout **deletes the row**, then clears the cookie                                                                                                                            | Captured token stays valid forever                        |
| Password change/reset deletes all *other* sessions for that user                                                                                                              | Account recovery leaves the attacker signed in            |
| Two expiries: absolute `expires_at` cap **and** idle timeout on `last_seen_at`                                                                                                | Sliding-only expiry lets a stolen token live indefinitely |
| Never store resolved permissions on the session row                                                                                                                           | A demoted admin keeps access until expiry                 |

Revocation is deletion — there is no separate mechanism. "Sign out this device", password
change, and admin-disables-user are all the same `DELETE FROM sessions` with a different
`WHERE`. If logout/login history is needed, it belongs in `audit_log`, not in retained
session rows.

Expired rows are swept lazily (delete that user's expired rows during login) rather than
by a scheduled job, per ADR-005.

**Consequence — operational traps.**

Express must be told it sits behind a proxy, or it reports the proxy's address as `req.ip`
*and* silently refuses to set `secure` cookies over a TLS-terminated connection — a
production-only failure that works fine on localhost:

```ts
app.getHttpAdapter().getInstance().set('trust proxy', 1);
```

Development must be same-origin. Vite proxies `/api` to Nest rather than the SPA calling
`http://localhost:3000` directly:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    proxy: { '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:3000', changeOrigin: true } },
  },
});
```

This mirrors the production topology (reverse proxy serving the SPA, forwarding `/api`).
Calling the API cross-origin in development means debugging CORS and `sameSite: 'none'`
problems that will never exist in production.

**Consequence — deferred, and how.** Mobile or third-party clients need a non-cookie
transport. This is additive: keep the auth guard's job as "resolve a request to
`(user, current_org)`" and read the credential at the edge, so a bearer transport is a new
strategy rather than a rewrite. Often the same opaque token can simply be returned in a
JSON body and sent as `Authorization: Bearer` — same table, same revocation, no JWT. If a
signed token is genuinely required, it carries `user_id` and `org_id` only; roles and
permissions are resolved per request (ADR-004).

**Related, landing in step 3.** `sameSite: 'lax'` blocks most but not all CSRF —
state-changing endpoints additionally require a custom header or double-submit token.
Login rate limiting keys on **email + IP together**: IP alone both fails against rotating
attackers and locks out everyone behind a corporate NAT. Note that `@nestjs/throttler`
counts in memory, so limits break silently across multiple instances — the first real
trigger for introducing Redis, alongside BullMQ (ADR-005).
