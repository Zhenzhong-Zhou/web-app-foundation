# ADR-013 — API versioning by URL prefix

> **Amended by [ADR-081](0081-old-tabs-after-a-deploy.md).**
> Within `/v1`, a change that breaks the app's own client raises the API revision, which the client sends as `X-Api-Revision` and the server checks first; `/v2` stays for a break an outside program would meet. Everything else stands.

## Context

Four options: a URL path prefix (`/v1/users`), a custom header
(`X-API-Version: 1`), Accept-header content negotiation
(`application/vnd.app.v1+json`), or a query parameter (`?version=1`).

Header-based versioning is the more theoretically correct design — a URL identifies a
resource, and the version is a property of its representation. In practice it is invisible
everywhere it matters: server logs, browser address bars, `curl` commands, bug reports,
and screenshots. It cannot be exercised by hand without a tool that sets headers, and
caching proxies need `Vary` configured correctly or they will serve one version's response
for another's request. Query parameters are worse still — trivially lost in redirects and
copy-pasted links.

The deciding factor is that this is a foundation intended to be handed to future
applications and, potentially, other developers. Legibility beats purity.

## Decision

URI versioning, applied globally from the first endpoint:

```ts
app.enableVersioning({ type: VersioningType.URI, defaultVersion: '1' });
```

Every API route is therefore `/v1/...`. Behind the Vite proxy (ADR-011) the browser-facing
path is `/api/v1/users`.

## Consequence

Version is visible in every log line and reproducible with a bare `curl`.
NestJS supports this natively, so no custom middleware is needed.

Operational endpoints are **excluded** from versioning: `/health`, and later `/metrics`,
are infrastructure rather than API surface. Load balancers and orchestrators should not
have to track an API version to run a liveness probe.

One global version, not per-module. Independently versioned modules produce combinations
no one has tested and questions no one can answer ("does `/v2/users` work with
`/v1/organizations`?").

A version bump is reserved for **breaking** changes — removing or renaming a field,
changing a type, altering semantics. Additive changes (new endpoints, new optional fields)
ship within the current version.

Realistically this foundation may never reach `v2`. That is the point: the prefix costs
nothing now, whereas adding it later forces a choice between breaking every existing client
and maintaining unversioned legacy routes indefinitely.
