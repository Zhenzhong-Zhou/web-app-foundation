# Architecture Decisions

A running log of structural decisions: what was chosen, why, and what it costs.
Append new entries; don't rewrite old ones. If a decision is reversed, add a new
entry that supersedes it and mark the old one.

Format: **Context** (the situation) → **Decision** (what was chosen) →
**Consequence** (what this now commits us to).

## ADR-001 — NestJS as the server framework

**Context.** Candidates were Spring Boot, Express, Next.js API routes, and NestJS.
Express is too minimal for a foundation project — everything (structure, DI, validation,
auth) would be hand-assembled. Next.js couples the API to the frontend framework and has
no story for background work, which is wrong for a platform meant to serve multiple future
applications and possibly non-browser clients. Spring Boot is the most mature option,
but the developer has no Java experience.

**Decision.** NestJS.

**Consequence.** One language across frontend and backend; types can be shared with the
React client. Only one unknown to learn (the framework), not two (language + framework).
NestJS's module/DI/guard model mirrors Spring closely enough that the concepts transfer if
a move to Spring ever happens. Cost: authorization tooling is less mature than Spring
Security, so more of the auth surface is hand-built.

## ADR-002 — PostgreSQL as the database

**Context.** The developer already uses Postgres regularly. The foundation needs JSON-ish
storage for settings and audit payloads, and a credible path to enforcing tenant isolation.

**Decision.** PostgreSQL 16, single database.

**Consequence.** JSONB is available for audit-log payloads and application settings.
Row-Level Security is available later as a second layer of tenant isolation without a
schema change (see ADR-003).

## ADR-003 — Multi-tenancy: shared schema with `organization_id`

**Context.** It is not yet known whether this will serve one organization or many
customers. The cost of the two mistakes is wildly asymmetric: designing for multi-tenancy
and never needing it costs one column and one seed row. Retrofitting tenancy onto a live
single-tenant database touches every table, every query, and every role assignment.

**Decision.** Design multi-tenant from day one, using a **shared schema** in a single
database. Every tenant-scoped table gets `organization_id NOT NULL`, a foreign key, and an
index — created with the table, never added later. One "Default Organization" row is
seeded. Schema-per-tenant and database-per-tenant were both rejected: they are only
justified by hard compliance/isolation requirements and are far harder to reverse.

**Consequence.** The tenant filter must live in **one place** — a request-scoped context
plus a base query layer that always applies it. If `where organization_id = ?` gets
scattered across services by hand, data will eventually leak between tenants. This is the
single highest-risk area of the codebase and needs a test.

Postgres Row-Level Security may be added later as defence in depth. It is cheap to add
*because the column already exists* — the column is the irreversible decision, RLS is not.

Deferred as additive, not blocking: organization signup/onboarding, org switcher UI,
per-org settings overrides, per-org billing.

## ADR-004 — Roles scoped through membership

**Context.** The obvious design is `user → role → permissions`. It breaks as soon as a
user belongs to two organizations, which is normal in any multi-tenant system.

**Decision.** Roles attach to a **membership**, not to a user:

```
users (global identity)
memberships (user_id, organization_id, role_id)
roles → role_permissions → permissions
```

Permissions are strings (`users.create`, `reports.view`) checked by a guard.

**Consequence.** A user can join a second organization with different roles, with no data
migration. Registration must create user + organization + Owner membership **in a single
transaction**. Permission checks must always resolve through the membership for the
*current* organization, never through the user alone.

Known limitation: string permissions handle global rules well but not resource-scoped ones
("Bob can edit *these* projects"). If that requirement appears, extend rather than replace —
attach a scope to the membership or adopt CASL-style ability rules.

## ADR-005 — No background jobs in V1; email sends synchronously

**Context.** A job queue means Redis, retry logic, dead-letter handling, and a second
process to run and deploy. In V1 the only async candidate is a handful of transactional
emails.

**Decision.** Send email synchronously. Use Mailpit in development — no SMTP provider,
no API keys, no signup. Defer BullMQ until sending actually becomes slow.

**Consequence.** Notably less infrastructure to run and learn while building. Slow SMTP
will block request threads; that is acceptable at V1 volume and is the signal to add the
queue. The change is purely additive — no schema or API impact.

---

## ADR-006 — Self-serve registration is the only onboarding path in V1

**Context.** Three onboarding models were on the table: self-serve registration, admin-
created users, and emailed invitations. Invitations are a full flow (token generation,
expiry, resend, accept-as-new vs. accept-as-existing, UI on both ends) — days of work.

**Decision.** V1 ships self-serve registration only. Invitations are deferred.

**Consequence.** Registration exercises auth, email verification, and organization
creation together, which is the most valuable single path to build first. Adding users to
an existing org in V1 is done directly by an admin. Invitations can be added later without
touching the schema.

---

## ADR-007 — React SPA on Vite, not Next.js

**Context.** The core surface is a logged-in dashboard: user management, roles, settings,
audit log. SSR and SEO are irrelevant behind a login wall. The developer already has
React + TypeScript + Vite experience.

**Decision.** React + TypeScript on Vite, as a separate SPA consuming the API.

**Consequence.** Frontend and backend stay decoupled, so a mobile or third-party client
can use the same API later. Admin CRUD screens should use a generator (Refine or React
Admin) rather than being hand-built.

---

## ADR-008 — Testing scaffolding lands in V1

**Context.** Comprehensive coverage is not realistic for a solo build. But the *habit* and
the *harness* are what's expensive to retrofit, not individual tests.

**Decision.** Set up the test database, factories, and one passing integration test as
part of the skeleton (step 1). From the first real feature onward, write one integration
test per feature as it's built.

**Consequence.** Tenant isolation and permission guards — the two places where a bug is a
security incident — always have a regression test.

# Open decisions

Decide these before or during step 1; each is cheap now and annoying later.

### ORM: Prisma vs. Drizzle
Drizzle is closer to raw SQL and will feel natural given existing Postgres experience.
Prisma has stronger migration tooling and a larger ecosystem. Leaning Prisma for the
migration story. **Must decide before step 2.**

### Primary key strategy: ULID/UUID vs. auto-increment integers
ULIDs are sortable, don't leak row counts, and are safe to expose in URLs. Sequential
integers leak business volume and are awkward across tenants. Leaning ULID.
**Effectively irreversible after step 2 — decide first.**

### Session strategy: httpOnly cookie sessions vs. JWT
For a first-party browser SPA, httpOnly cookies are simpler and safer (no token storage
in JS, straightforward revocation). JWT is more convenient if a mobile or third-party
client arrives. Leaning cookie sessions, since the SPA is the only planned client.

### Account deletion vs. audit retention
"Delete my account" and "audit log records who did what" are in direct tension under GDPR.
Decide the policy — likely anonymize the user record while retaining audit rows with a
tombstoned actor reference — **before real user data exists.**

### API versioning
Prefix routes with `/v1/` from the first endpoint. Nearly free now, disruptive later.
