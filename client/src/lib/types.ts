/**
 * Shapes the server returns, shared rather than redeclared per feature.
 *
 * Location was declared twice — once in locations-page for the tree, once in
 * inventory-page for the picker — with different fields. Nothing compares the
 * two, so they would drift silently until a component read a property the
 * other's rows did not carry.
 *
 * These describe the API's responses, not the database. A column the client
 * never reads does not belong here.
